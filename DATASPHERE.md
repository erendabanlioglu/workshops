## Scenario 1: Product purchase prediction with Spark MLlib

**Description**: Within this scenario you will develop spark mllib model to predict product purchases. Next you will deploy this model as web service and bind sample web  application to it. The application will send scoring records to deployed model and display predicted purchases.

### Jupyter Notebook

### Node.js application


## Scenario 2: Style transfer with Keras
**Description**: In this scenario you will learn how to run deep learning experiment to transfer style from famous painting (e.g. Picasso) to your photo.

### Jupyter Notebook

### Python web application
